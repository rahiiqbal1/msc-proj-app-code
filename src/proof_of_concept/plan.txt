Want to give some of the fields in the json to txtai for indexing, take a 
search query from the user, then return a list of relevant results giving both
title and url.

Text should be cleaned beforehand, removing punctuation, stopwords,
lemmatising. 

Code to clean and whatnot should be easily adjustable for different desired 
fields.
